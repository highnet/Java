MANU PATCH 0.15

IMPORTANT !!! HOW TO RUN:


Create a folder called Data inside your main project folder. same folder where the src folder is located.

place the files WORLD.txt WORLD2.txt RNG.txt inside the Data folder.

compile will fail if these files do not exist. ?? (i think)


Changes:

Pre generated RNG number list reader. Read a whitespace separated list of pre-generated rng numbers from a file.

Map save to file function.

Map read from file function.

Npc Ai;  Movement and collision detection. Ai random walks every X action ticks.  
(NOTE: CURRENTLY SUPPORTS ONLY ONE NPC, i think, must investigate. would probably have to make the method run in a for each
loop that iterates through each npc in the npcList list.)

Main menu:

the 0 key reveals the map or reopens the main menu. 
( note: currently a new map is generated only once at runtime. pressing 0 only hides or reveals the main menu)

the 9 key loads a pre generated map contained in the WORLD2.txt file as long as the main menu is open.
(NOTE: the map contained in WORLD2.txt is an example of what happens when the world is generated with a too short list of RNG
numbers inside RNG.txt,  it might be an useful effect for constructing cities/forests/regular structures))
