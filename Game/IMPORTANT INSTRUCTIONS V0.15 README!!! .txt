MANU PATCH 0.15

IMPORTANT !!! HOW TO RUN:


Create a folder called Data inside your main project folder. same folder where the src folder is located.

place the file RNG.txt inside the Data folder.

Create a folder called GFX inside the Data folder you just created.  place the files Tree.png and Rock.gif in the GFX folder

compile will fail if these files does not exist.


Changes:



Pre generated RNG number list reader. Read a whitespace separated list of pre-generated rng numbers from a file.

Map save to file function.

Map read from file function.

GAME now automatically generates 5 maps and stores them in 5 .txt files it automatically creates in the Data folder.

Npc Ai;  Movement and collision detection. Ai random walks every X action ticks.  
(NOTE: works for multiple npc's with the possibilty of adding different ai's per npc)

Sprite draw engine

Main menu:

the 0 key reveals the map or reopens the main menu. 
( note: currently new maps are generated only once at runtime. pressing 0 only hides or reveals the main menu)

the 9 key loads the next pre-generated map from the data folder only if the main menu is currently displayed.
currently it cycles through each of the 5 maps generated at runtime.
