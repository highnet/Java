TODO: 

Npc movement and interaction.

Tile occupied by npc is made "occupied" at npc generation.  would need to be updated for every npc movement !! . 

Currently only one Npc test case is generated at start.   how would i generate X number of npc's for a given map, each with different position and each individualy interactable and with it's own movement/attributes.

Current WOLDGEN function is almost purely random.  must add some conditional generation ( eg: "wall"/"water" tiles more likely to spawn near other "wall"/"water tiles to form rock outcrops/lakes. )

BUGS INTRODUCED!!!!:    

Unkown.
